# What is This?

This repository tracks my solutions to coding problems from [exercism.io](exercism.io). Exercism provides coding challenges 
in a multitude of languages along with real world feedback from other users to help students improve their programming abilities. The site provides
challenges in numerous languages, but this repository currently focuses on Ruby alone. 

For more information about Exercism, see [here](http://exercism.io/getting-started). 

Review and leave comments on the solutions [here](http://exercism.io/viparthasarathy).
